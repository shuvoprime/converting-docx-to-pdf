# converting-from-docx-to-pdf

Enter the name of your .docx file in place of the dummy name Name_Of_Your_Doc_File. Make sure both the .py file and the .docx file are in the same folder for avoiding conflicts.  

This code will simply change the file format and create a new file in the same location and with the same contents but in .pdf format.
